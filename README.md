Ryxie's Baliwbrary Project #1 - Eijiro's Storybook

DISCLAIMER AND COPYRIGHT: 

I ONLY OWNED THE SCRIPT (story plot + some programming stuffs). Game assets such as images and music that are being used here are from the owners (see "Credits" section) which I modified a bit (I checked their terms and it's okay to do so). And this game is made using Ren'Py VN Engine, so I don't own the game engine as well (if only I can make my own.... *sulking in a corner*) 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

Well, basically this is my first step on making a visual novel (finally, after 90380802830 years!), though my only roles on this one are just coding a bit and running my weird imagination to the max (for short, programmer+writer). The reason why I decided to put this on GitHub is... well, more like convenience + project back-up + traning-myself-to-get-used-on-this-complicated(for me)-structure. Anyway, I DON'T INTEND TO SELL THIS ONE (since I don't have the right to do so, as part of the terms in using those assets), but it will be HIGHLY APPRECIATED if you leave this cr-- source code untouched (like using the script for another sets of assets... well, you know what I mean).

STORY DESCRIPTION:

It's about a.... no, it's better to leave this section secret until the tests are okay. (Well, it's my first time on using this one! T___T)
